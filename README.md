### 🔥 What Makes These Projects Special

<details>
<summary><b>🧠 The "Society as Neural Network" Breakthrough</b></summary>
<br>
This isn't just another AI project - it's a paradigm shift. By modeling entire societies as neural networks, I'm exploring how we can optimize for fairness, efficiency, and meritocracy simultaneously. The intersection of social simulation, policy optimization, and AI ethics positions this work at the forefront of responsible AI development.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚡ Edge AI: Making LLMs Accessible Everywhere</b></summary>
<br>
While everyone talks about massive cloud models, I'm solving the real problem: getting powerful AI to run locally on edge devices. My work on model quantization and compression for Jetson Orin Nano makes advanced NLP accessible in healthcare settings, remote locations, and privacy-sensitive environments.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🏥 Healthcare AI with Regulatory Compliance</b></summary>
<br>
My thesis combines BERT/GPT with strict healthcare regulations - a combination that's desperately needed but rarely done right. I'm building QA and search systems that don't just work technically, but actually pass regulatory scrutiny and earn doctor trust.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 The Observability Pattern Across All Projects</b></summary>
<br>
Every project includes robust monitoring and logging - not as an afterthought, but as a core design principle. Whether it's tracking model performance, system health, or social simulation metrics, observability is how I ensure AI systems are trustworthy and debuggable.
