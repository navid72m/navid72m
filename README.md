### 🔥 What I'm Passionate About

<details>
<summary><b>🏥 Responsible AI in Healthcare</b></summary>
<br>
Building AI systems that healthcare professionals actually trust and use. My thesis focuses on developing QA and search pipelines using BERT and GPT for regulated healthcare texts - because AI in healthcare isn't just about accuracy, it's about compliance, interpretability, and real-world usability.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 System Observability & Architecture</b></summary>
<br>
Every role I've had involved improving logging, monitoring, and system architecture. I believe in building systems that don't just work, but systems that tell you WHY they work (or don't). Observability isn't just monitoring - it's understanding.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🌉 Cross-Cultural Tech Innovation</b></summary>
<br>
Having worked across Iran and Germany, I've seen how different cultures approach technology problems. This gives me unique insights into building globally accessible tech solutions and international team collaboration.
